# Git Basics: How to Add, Commit, Push, and Pull in GitHub for Newbies

Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers track changes to their code and collaborate with others. If you're new to Git and GitHub, this guide will walk you through the basic commands you need to know to add, commit, push, and pull changes to a GitHub repository.

---

## Why Use Git and GitHub?

1. **Version Control**: Git tracks changes in your code, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
2. **Collaboration**: GitHub allows teams to collaborate on projects by sharing and managing code online.
3. **Backup**: By pushing code to GitHub, you create a backup of your project in the cloud.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following set up:
1. **Git Installed**: Check if Git is installed by running:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   If not installed, you can install Git with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git  # On Linux
   brew install git      # On Mac
   ```
   Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) for Windows.

2. **GitHub Account**: Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

3. **GitHub Repository**: Either create a new repository on GitHub or clone an existing one.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Git Basics

### 1. **Clone a Repository**

If you have a repository on GitHub and want to work with it on your local machine, clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```
This will download the repository to your local machine.

---

### 2. **Check the Status of Your Repo**

Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd your-repository
```
Check the current status of your repository:
```bash
git status
```
This command shows which files have been modified, added, or staged for commit.

---

### 3. **Add Changes**

When you modify or create new files, you need to "stage" them for the next commit:
```bash
git add filename
```
To add all modified and new files:
```bash
git add .
```

---

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**

Once you've staged your changes, commit them with a message describing what you did:
```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

---

### 5. **Push Changes to GitHub**

After committing, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```
> **Note**: Replace `main` with your branch name if it's different.

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and personal access token (instead of your password).

---

### 6. **Pull Changes from GitHub**

If someone else has made changes to the repository, you need to update your local copy by pulling the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This will merge the remote changes into your local branch.

---

### 7. **View Commit History**

To see the commit history, run:
```bash
git log
```
Press `q` to exit the log view.

---

### 8. **Create a New Branch (Optional)**

If you want to work on a new feature or bug fix, it's a good idea to create a new branch:
```bash
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
```
Or, create and switch to the new branch in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

After making changes, you can push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin new-feature
```

## Final Tips

- **Commit Often**: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.
